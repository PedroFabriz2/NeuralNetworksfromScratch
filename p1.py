# common neuron : output = input*weight + bias

input = [1,2,3]
output = []
bias = 3
weights = [0.2,0.3,0.4]

# neuron:

output = input[0]*weights[0] + input[1]*weights[1] + input[2]*weights[2] + bias
#print(bias)

# This is basically what a neuron does in the neural network, we just have to put together a bunch of them.
